				Installing openBVE on Windows
			</h1>
			<div>
				In order to install openBVE on Windows, please follow the instructions below. It is assumed that you know how to download files from the internet and how to extract ZIP files. If not, please look up how to do these things somewhere else.
			</div>
			<h2>
				<a id="createtheinstalldirectory">Create the Install Directory</a>
			</h2>
			<div>
				The first thing you should do is to create the install directory. This directory can be anywhere on your hard drive and can have any name you want, for example "openBVE". It is where you will deploy the files that you are about to download.
			</div>
			<h2>
				<a id="downloadthemainprogram">Download the Main Program</a>
			</h2>
			<div>
				Download the <a href="../common/openbve_stable.zip">latest stable version</a>
				of the openBVE main program and extract the ZIP file to your install directory.
			</div>
			<h2>
				<a id="downloadtao">Download Tao</a>
			</h2>
			<div>
				Download <a href="../common/tao.zip">this ZIP file</a>
				and extract it to your install directory.
			</div>
			<h2>
				<a id="downloadsdl">Download SDL</a>
			</h2>
			<div>
				Download <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.15-win32.zip">this ZIP file</a>
				and extract it to your install directory.
			</div>
			<h2>
				<a id="downloadopenal">Download OpenAL</a>
			</h2>
			<div>
				Download <a href="http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/oalinst.zip">this ZIP file</a>
				and extract it anywhere on your hard drive. It contains an installer that you should run and which will install OpenAL onto your computer.
			</div>
			<h2>
				<a id="downloadnet">Download .NET</a>
			</h2>
			<div>
				Please download the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17113">here</a>
				unless you already have it.
			</div>
			<h2>
				<a id="userdata">User Data</a>
			</h2>
			<div>
				By default, all of the options you can set up in openBVE and all the add-ons you download through openBVE are not stored in the install directory, but in a directory specific to your operating system. If you want this "userdata" inside your install directory, download <a href="../common/userdata_in_install_directory.zip">this ZIP file</a>
				and extract it to your install directory.
			</div>
			<h2>
				<a id="startopenbve">Start openBVE</a>
			</h2>
			<div>
				You can now start OpenBve.exe from your install directory and start playing.
			</div>
			<div>
				If you have run into problems during the installation process, please see the <a href="troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a>
				section for some commonly encounterd problems.
			</div>
			<div>
				It is also highly recommended that you browse through the <a href="index.html">Install and Play</a>
				pages. You can find valuable information there such as the keyboard assignment and a general overview on how to operate trains.
			</div>
			<div>
				If you ever want to update openBVE to the latest available version, you only need to download the main program again and extract it to your install directory. You do not have to download the other stuff again.
			</div>
			<div>
				You can download routes and trains directly from inside the game. Please see <a href="managed.html">managed add-ons for users</a>
				for the details.
			</div>
			<div>
				There are also plenty of legacy add-ons, particularly for BVE Trainsim, that can also be used but must be found and installed manually. Some authors of such add-ons make it easy for you by providing a single archive that just needs to be extracted somewhere, while others make it very complicated. You have to read <a href="folders.html">the folder structure for legacy routes and trains</a>
				before even considering to install such add-ons.
