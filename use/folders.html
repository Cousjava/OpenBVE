				The folder structure for legacy routes and trains
			</h1>
			<div>
				All legacy routes and trains follow a certain folder structure. This folder structure can be present anywhere on your computer as long as everything is kept together. The folder structure consists of the two base folders <strong>Railway</strong> and <strong>Train</strong>. Inside Railway, there are the additional three folders <strong>Route</strong>, <strong>Object</strong> and <strong>Sound</strong>.
			</div>
			<div>
				In order to select a route from the main menu, select the <strong>Browse manually</strong> tab and then browse to your Railway\Route folder and select any CSV/RW file inside. All compatible files are highlighted in the main menu via a route icon.
			</div>
			<div>
				In order to select a train from the main menu, select the <strong>Browse manually</strong> tab and then browse to your Train folder and select any subfolder inside. All compatible subfolders are highlighted in the main menu via a train icon.
			</div>
			<div>
				When downloading legacy routes or trains from the internet, be sure that the downloads either contain this folder structure, or create the folders manually and copy everything into the correct place.
			</div>
			<div>
				Please note that while we encourage add-on developers to always include the base folders Railway and Train in their distributions so all you need is to extract the archives anywhere, most add-on developers do not follow this recommendation and expect you to move raw files around until you get the add-on working somehow. Unfortunately, we have no control over that.
