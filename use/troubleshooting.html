							openBVE uses OpenGL for 3D graphics, which is implemented in the graphics driver. Without adequate support for OpenGL by the graphics driver, openBVE might run in software mode without hardware acceleration, or with reduced performance. If you have never updated your graphics driver before, this would be a good time to try a newer version, or if you are using the latest version, to try an older version. You should never rely on the default drivers that ship with Microsoft Windows. They generally produce poor performance. In order to download drivers, please see the website of the chipset manufacturer (usually <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us">NVIDIA</a>, <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx">ATI</a>
							or <a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/">Intel</a>
							). Also make sure performance is not artificially reduced by graphics driver settings (such as ATI PowerPlay).
