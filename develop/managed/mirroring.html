			<h1>
				Managed add-ons - Uploading backups of packages to your own server
			</h1>
			<div>
				You can help keeping add-ons up and running by uploading backup copies to your own server. All add-ons released as managed content come with a license that allows you to make verbatim copies under no conditions.
			</div>
			<div>
				In order to make a backup of an add-on, navigate to your managed content directory, pick the package you want to create a backup of, <a href="basics.html#packaging">package it correctly</a>, then <a href="basics.html#thedescriptor">add a [package] section to your descriptor</a>, and finally upload everything to your server.
			</div>
			<div>
				Actually, you only need the following five entries for each [package] section in your descriptor if you want to publish a backup of an already existing package:
			</div>
			<table class="table-grid">
				<tr>
					<td>
						<tt>
							[package] <br />
							name = animated-object-demo-route <br />
							version = 1.0 <br />
							size = 1069556 <br />
							md5 = 4C8D3D814F4A68E4CD7A9C5F784B817A <br />
							sources = http://trainsimframework.org/common/animated-object-demo-route.tar.gz <br />
						</tt>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<div>
				In fact, any additional metadata will be ignored (same-origin policy). In order to find out the exact package name and version of the package you are about to make a backup of, inspect the package.cfg in the root directory of the package.
			</div>
			<div>
				When you repackage an add-on, it will inevitably end up with a different file size and MD5 then the original. This is not a problem for as long as the content of your tarball matches the original on a file-by-file basis, meaning no files may be added, changed or removed. The only exception is the package.cfg file - its presence is ignored. Please make sure to denote the correct file size and MD5 of your tarball - you can also use <a href="../../common/md5.zip">this tool</a>
				in order to create the size and md5 lines automatically.
			</div>
			<div>
				Once you have uploaded the tarball and the descriptor to your server, please submit the URL to your descriptor to the openBVE project:
			</div>
			<div>
				<img src="../../common/mail.png" alt="E-mail address is hidden in this image" />
			</div>
			<div>
				You can at any time add more [package] sections to your descriptor - any change you make will be picked up <strong>automatically</strong> by a crawler, meaning you have to submit your descriptor only once, not every time you make a change.
