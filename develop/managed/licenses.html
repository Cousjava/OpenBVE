			<h1>
				Managed add-ons - Accepted licenses
			</h1>
			<div>
				All packages that you want to make available under managed content must contain a <strong>LICENSE</strong> file in the root directory of the package. The LICENSE file must contain either of the following licenses.
			</div>
			<h2>
				<a id="verbatimcopylicense">Verbatim Copy License</a>
			</h2>
			<table class="table-grid">
				<tr>
					<td>
						<tt>
							This add-on is placed under the following license: <br />
							<br />
							YOU ARE ALLOWED TO MAKE VERBATIM COPIES OF THIS ADD-ON. <br />
							<br />
							There are no terms and no conditions. This applies worldwide and is unlimited in duration. If additional permissions are granted, they are covered in a separate license.
						</tt>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<div>
				Using this license, you allow everyone to make verbatim copies of your add-on. A verbatim copy - for clarification - means making an exact replica with nothing added, nothing changed and nothing removed. Of course you are free to grant additional rights under the terms of your choice - in this case use a separate file to cover those rights.
			</div>
			<h2>
				<a id="publicdomaindedication">Public Domain Dedication</a>
			</h2>
			<table class="table-grid">
				<tr>
					<td>
						<tt>
							THIS ADD-ON IS PLACED IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. <br />
							<br />
							If this is not legally possible, you are given permission to use the add-on in any way you want (including redistribution and modification). There are no terms and no conditions. This applies worldwide and is unlimited in duration.
						</tt>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<div>
				Using this dedication, you basically "waive" your exclusive rights so that your add-on becomes a common good to everyone. We have included a fallback license for countries that do not recognize the concept of explicitly releasing a work into the public domain. The result is the same though, because in this case, you basically grant everyone a license to do whatever they want with your work.
