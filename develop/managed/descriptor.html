				Managed add-ons - The descriptor file
			</h1>
			<div>
				The descriptor contains information on all packages that you offer on your server. You can change the file at any time to introduce new packages, newer versions of existing packages or to update metadata.
			</div>
			<div>
				All you have to do is to submit the URL to the descriptor <strong>once</strong> to the openBVE project. After that, it will be crawled automatically at least once every 48 hours in order to collect any changes you made to it.
			</div>
			<div>
				Please find a list of things you can do in your descriptor below, in particular a list of all available metadata

			<h3>
				<a id="languagecodes">Language codes</a>
			</h3>
			<div>
				Some metadata such as country, city and description can be offered in multiple languages. You do so by including a language code in brackets, for example:
			</div>
			<table class="table-grid">
				<tr>
					<td>
						<tt>
							country[en-US] = Japan <br />
							country[ja-JP] = 日本
						</tt>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<div>
				Please always include an English version of the metadata. For a full list of codes, see <a href="http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm">here</a>.
			</div>
			<h2>
				<a id="thelinkssection">The [links] section</a>
			</h2>
			<div>
				If you want to organize yourself with others in your own communities, it is also possible that you include a <strong>[links]</strong> section. Instead of having to submit their descriptors to the openBVE project directly, other developers can also submit them to you. You then list those URLs in the [links] section, each URL on a separate line. Once the crawler reads your descriptor, all descriptors you link to will be automatically added to the crawler's database.
